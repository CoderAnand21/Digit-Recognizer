# Digit Recognizer with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for recognizing handwritten digits. The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which is a classic dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels (0-9).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize pixel values, reshape images, and preprocess data for training machine learning models.
  
- **Model Selection:** Implement and compare different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess performance.
  
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model for inference on new images or in a production environment.
